I2C_DETECT=`i2cdetect -y 1 | grep '\-\-' | cut -d: -f2 | grep [0-9a-fA-F] | awk '{ i = 1; while (i <= NF) { if($i != "--") print $i; i++} }'`

I2C_ADDRESS="0x${I2C_DETECT}"

# Get value already installed
I2C_ADDRESS_PREV=`grep '^ADDRESS' /home/pi/RetroPie-Clcd/I2C_LCD_driver.py | cut -d= -f2 | sed 's/ //'`

# Change config and restart service when different value detect
if [ $I2C_ADDRESS != $I2C_ADDRESS_PREV ]
